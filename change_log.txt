CluE Oxide: 0.2.2-alpha.6

ADDED:

Expanded the Python API.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CluE Oxide: 0.2.2-alpha.5

ADDED:

Added PhysicalConstants to PyCluE.

CHANGED:

Changed defualt partitioning method to Particles.

Fixed bug where the extra charge site in TIP4P would cause CluE Oxide to crash.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CluE Oxide: 0.2.2-alpha.4

ADDED:

Expanded the Python API.


CHANGED:

Changed data type of Config fields, "write_*", from Option<String>,
to Option<bool>, to better match the API.

Changed keyword "sphere" to "ball".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CluE Oxide: 0.2.2-alpha.3

ADDED: 

Partitioning CCE (pCCE)[1,2] has been added.  
Note that keyword related to pCCE are liekly 
to change in the next couple versions.
The keword "partitioning_method" can be used to select the partitioning method.
Currently the available methods are "particles", which is the same as normal
CCE, and "exchange_groups_and_particles" which partitions methyls and
primary amonium groups as a block and all other spins as their own blocks.
The "unit_of_clustering" can be "spin" or "set".  This determines what the n
in n-CCE referes to.  For example, a block that contains a methyl group,
is one block, but contains three spins, so 
  unit_of_clustering = set;
treats the methyl as a 1-cluster, while 
  unit_of_clustering = spin;
treats the methyl as a 3-cluster.  Using the latter together with choosing the
"partitioning_method" makes "remove_partial_methyls" redundant.

Added keyword "max_spin_order".  This will drop clusters with more than the 
specified number of spins.  For example when "unit_of_clustering" is "set",
a 2-cluster of of a hydrogen and a methyl group contains four spins,
but a 2-cluster of two methyl groups contains six spins.  
Setting "max_spin_order = 4;", will keep the former cluster, 
but drop the latter.
Note that "max_spin_order" should not be used if "unit_of_clustering" is "spin".

REMOVED:

The "remove_partial_methyls" keyword has been removed.  
See above on the addition of pCCE.

CHANGED:

Fixed bug where a leading "+" in the exponent in e-notation such as "1e+11",
would get parsed incorrectly.

CluE Oxide: 0.2.2-alpha.2

ADDED:

Expanded the Python API.

Added keyword "atom_names" to filter particle groups by the atom name.

REMOVED:

Removed unused keyword "element" and "residue".  
Note that keywords "elements" and "residues" are kept.

CHANGED:

Updated ndarray-rand to version 0.15.0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CluE Oxide: 0.2.2-alpha.1

CHANGED:

Isotropic tensors no longer require axes to be specified.

ADDED: 

Tensors can now be specified directly, rather than just by eigenvalues and
eigenvectors.  For example both
  g_matrix = [1, 2, 3,
              4, 5, 6,
              7, 8, 9];
and
  g_matrix = [1, 2, 3,
                 5, 6,
                    9];
give the same symmetric matrix
  [1, 2, 3,
   2, 5, 6,
   3, 6, 9];
note that the lower triangle entries are discarded.  The axes should not be
specified when using this method.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CluE Oxide: 0.2.1

FIXED:

In the dependencies, updated the ndarray-linalg version to fix compilation 
errors on Windows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CluE Oxide: 0.2.0-alpha.2
2024-04-23

FIXED:

Bug fixed where find_exchange_groups() would give the wrong centroid value
for methyl groups.

CHANGED:

Particle indices in save files are now more consistent; bath particles start 
at 1, and increment by one for each atom regardless off whether the particle is 
active or not, or even has a spin.

The exchage_groups.csv now uses the same origin as the PDB, rather than
setting the detected electron to the origin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CluE Oxide: 0.2.0-alpha.1
2024-01-09

CHANGED:

The "filter" keyword has been deprecated and is replaced by "group".

If a particle falls under multiple groups (previously called filters),
CluE now errs rather than making an order dependent assignment.

Config arguments starting with "write_" now take bools rather than strings.

The config argument 
  temperature = T;
has been removed.  Use 
  cluster_density_matrix = thermal(T);
instead.

The config argument "neighbor_cutoff_dipole_dipole" has been renamed
"neighbor_cutoff_coupling".


ADDED:

The input modes "#[group()]", "#[structure_properties()]", and
"#[spin_properties()]" can now take either positional arguments or keyword
arguments.

Groups can be made specific to the primary unit cell by adding
  primary_cell;
within a #[group()] section, or to all cells other than the primary cell via
  extracells;
If neither is supplied, than the group applies to all cells.

Within a #[structure_properties(my_label)] section, the option
  cosubstitute = same_molecule;
is now available to enforce that atoms in the group my_label that are on the
same molecule are the same isotope.  Note that atoms not in the my_label group
are not affected regardless of which molecule they are on.

The option "void_probability" has been added.

The option "write_methyl_partitions" was added.

The option "write_sans_spin_signals" was added.

REMOVED:

The option "extracell_isotope_abundances" has been removed.

The option "extracell_void_probability" has been removed.

The option "cell_ids" has been removed.
